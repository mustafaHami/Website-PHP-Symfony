## My Project on PHP(Symfony)
###### This is a website developed in Twig, Css, Bootstrap and PHP(Symfony). I realized this project during my licence.

<sub> :warning: **Information** : If you want to download my project, you must have WAMP or MAMP for the database. Then you need to import the file 'mi5.sql' (located in the BD folder) to have all the files including all the entities. </sub>
